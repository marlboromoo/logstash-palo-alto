Configuring Syslog
==============================

I'm using rsyslog in a centralized syslog server configuration. My configuration
is pretty terrible, so I'm not going to share it. 

I do recmmend sticking with version 5 of rsyslog, though. It's pretty straight 
forward to set up centralized syslogging with it.
